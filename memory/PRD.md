# QORVENA · Bitumen Transport ERP — PRD

## Product summary
QORVENA is a Bitumen transport ERP tracking LRs, Trips, Freight, Shortage, Invoices, Payments, Suppliers, Customers, Vehicles, Drivers, Products, Fuel, and Reports. FastAPI + React + MongoDB. Auth via Emergent-managed Google, with a dev-only demo token.

## Preferred language
User frequently switches between English and Telugu. Detect the language of the user's prompt and respond in the same. Application UI itself is bilingual by design.

## Locked business rules (do NOT change without explicit approval)
- **Duplicate Masters** (Iter127a):
  - **Customer** — GSTIN + PAN blocked; **Name** warning bypassable via *Continue Creating* (`X-Confirm-Name-Match: allow`); Phone advisory only. Owner/Admin can override GSTIN/PAN via `X-Duplicate-Override` with reason.
  - **Supplier** — GSTIN, PAN, and **Name** all blocked; Mobile advisory only. NO *Continue Creating* button.
  - **Vehicle** — vehicle_number match is IDEMPOTENT; returns existing row.
- **Ship-To Independence** — Ship-To State independent of Customer State; GSTIN derives State/State Code.
- **Trip Loading vs Unloading** — separate stages. Freight at dispatch; shortage only after unload data.
- **Missing Unload Data** — "Not Available Yet", not zero. Pre-unload invoices must not fabricate shortages.
- **Invoice Number** — Server-assigned `{Prefix}/{FY}/{Sequence}`. No per-invoice override. Prefix + Next Number in **Settings** only, Owner/Admin.
- **Invoice Ship-To** — Preview and PDF identical. GSTIN normalised on display. Unload Date renders correctly.
- **Invoice PDF Page X of Y** — every page. Signature block on last page only.
- **Supplier Deactivate/Reactivate** — soft-delete. Owner/Admin only. Historical data preserved.
- **Draft Recovery** — only meaningful, non-empty forms are offered for restore.
- **Deploy Readiness Badge** (Iter128) — `/api/admin/deploy-readiness` + `/api/admin/deploy-history` role-gated to Owner/Admin/Manager (403 otherwise). Frontend badge polls every 60s, paused when tab hidden.
- **Iter129 Phase 1 Security Hardening**:
  - CORS restricted via `CORS_ORIGINS` env (fallback to `*` only if empty); `allow_credentials=False`.
  - Response security headers on every route: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(self), geolocation=()`, `Content-Security-Policy` (with `frame-ancestors 'none'`).
  - `/api/files/public/{obj_path}` — path-traversal + prefix allow-list (`lr_shares/` or `public/` only; blocks `..`, leading `/`, backslash).
  - File-upload allow-list — JPG / JPEG / PNG / WEBP / HEIC / HEIF / PDF only; other types return 415. Existing stored files unaffected.

## Completed work (rolling log)
- **Iter126, Iter127a, Iter127b, Iter127c** — LOCKED
- **P0 "REFRESHING..." stability** — CLOSED
- **User Manual v1.0 (English)** — LOCKED · UAT approved
- **Iter128 · Deploy Readiness Badge** — 🔒 LOCKED · UAT approved 2026-08-29
- **Xdist Test Cleanup** — 🔒 LOCKED · UAT approved 2026-08-29 (test-only; Iter46 UUID-namespaced fixtures + Iter43 read-after-write retry)
- **Iter129 Phase 1 Security Hardening** — 🔒 LOCKED · UAT approved 2026-08-29
  - Files: `backend/server.py` (+40/−8), `backend/routers/files.py` (+44/−8), new `backend/tests/test_iter129_sec_phase1_hardening.py` (13 tests)
  - Verified: 13/13 targeted tests · full regression 503 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed · exit 0 · Iter128 badge remains Ready · desktop + mobile smokes clean · no console errors
  - Zero touches to Iter126/127a-c/128, P0, User Manual, Save Health, Auth, Invoice, Freight, Shortage, Tax, LR, Supplier, Regression Guard
  - Single approved backend restart used; no other restarts

## Frozen — do NOT start without explicit instruction
- **Phase 2 security items** 🧊 (pending separate approvals):
  - Save Health role-gating
  - Deploy Readiness `/run-now` role-gating
  - Auth / localStorage token removal
  - Demo-token production configuration (pending platform/deployment confirmation)
  - Global 500-error sanitisation
  - Sensitive-field range validators
- Preview Uptime Chip 🧊
- LR Register Email Digest 🧊
- User Manual footer distribution link 🧊
- Credit / Debit Notes 🧊
- All Iter126 / Iter127a-c / Iter128 / Iter129 Phase 1 / P0 locked functionality 🔒

## Backlog (later, on user's call only)
- **P2** Trip 8279 missing-Ship-To data-hygiene nudge
- **P3** Trip Templates feature completion
- **P3** QORVENA global rebranding rename
- **Deferred** Iter105 Demo-Customer UAT
- **Deferred** "Disk newer than in-memory" backend guardrail
- **Idea** In-app Help side-drawer

## Explicitly deferred by user
- IGST vs CGST/SGST recalculation based on independent Ship-To State.
- Freezing historical invoice Ship-To strings as snapshots.
- Adding `effective_role` to `/api/auth/me` — auth frozen; Iter128 badge uses backend 403 as the gate.

## Critical operational notes
- Backend does **NOT** auto-reload. Any change under `/app/backend` requires `sudo supervisorctl restart backend`.
- `/app/memory/test_credentials.md` holds the demo token and OAuth email used for UAT.
- Manual regen: `python3 /app/docs/build_manual.py`
- Fresh deploy-readiness run: `POST /api/admin/deploy-readiness/run-now` (~10-11 min); poll `GET /api/admin/deploy-readiness` for status.
- Deploy Readiness Badge component: `/app/frontend/src/components/DeployReadinessBadge.jsx`
- Security headers + CORS + upload allow-list are locked in `server.py` and `routers/files.py`; touching them requires explicit approval.
